# ES Class Fields & Static Properties

This presents two related proposals: "class instance fields" and "class static fields". "Class instance fields" describe properties intended to exist on instances of a class (and may optionally include initializer expressions for said properties). "Class static fields" are declarative properties that exist on the class object itself (and may optionally include initializer expressions for said properties).

This proposal is currently at [Stage 2](https://github.com/tc39/proposals).
